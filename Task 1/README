This is to implement a cipher & to Build a tool that takes a string of text as input and encrypts it using a cipher.
The program is written in Java.(Use a Java Compiler to run the code)
CaesarCipherEncryption.java is the main file you have to run.
  -  Enter plain text you want to encrypt
  -  Enter the number by which you want to shift
  -  That's it you will have your encryted text.
